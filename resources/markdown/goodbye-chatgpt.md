# Goodbye ChatGPT

#### April 9, 2024

ChatGPT has finally been eclipsed (wink wink) by newer models and platforms.

Since the recent Claude 3 releases, our Twitter/X feeds are filled with ChatGPT users cancelling or considering
cancelling their $20 monthly ChatGPT Plus subscription to switch to the $20 monthly Claude Pro. (And some people
switching back.)

Yeah but what about Gemini? Or Perplexity? Or the latest open model? Ahhhh WHO SHOULD YOU BE PAYING-- FOR WHAT?!

What a pain! Let's make it easier for you:

**_Just pay OpenAgents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111_**

Our $10/month Pro plan right now gets you the top 9 chat models from Mistral, Anthropic, and OpenAI.

We aim to be the last AI subscription you'll ever need.

And guess what:

- OpenAgents is available globally. If one of the big corporate chat UIs won't work for you because of where you live,
  OpenAgents
  should work just fine.
- OpenAgents is [100% open-source](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents). Don't like our models or limits or
  features or
  whatever? Fork it and change it or just run it locally with your own API keys.
- OpenAgents will have not only the best models, but also soon the best agents. Read more about
  that [here](https://openagents.com/launch).

Now watch me cancel my ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro subscriptions,
then [try OpenAgents for yourself](https://openagents.com/).

Basic models require no account, medium models require a free account, and advanced models require Pro. Enjoy!
